        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is known for its impressive size and distinct features. Here are some key facts and characteristics about Jupiter:

<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
- **Size**: Jupiter has a diameter of about 139,822 kilometers (86,881 miles), making it more than 11 times the diameter of Earth.<br>
- **Mass**: It is about 318 times as massive as Earth, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total mass of all the planets in the solar system.<br>
- **Composition**: Jupiter is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases.<br>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
- **Weather**: Jupiter has a dynamic atmosphere with powerful storms, including the Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries.<br>
- **Cloud Bands**: The planet features distinctive cloud bands that are a result of high-speed winds in its atmosphere, creating turbulence and storms.<br>

<h2>Moons and Rings</h2>
- **Moons**: Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, with the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—collectively known as the Galilean moons. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.<br>
- **Rings**: Jupiter has a faint ring system composed mainly of dust particles and small rocks, which is less prominent than those of Saturn.<br>

<h2>Magnetosphere</h2>
- **Magnetic Field**: Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, producing intense radiation belts and auroras at its poles.<br>
- **Interaction with Moons**: The magnetic field interacts with its moons, particularly Io, which is volcanically active due to tidal heating caused by gravitational forces from Jupiter.<br>

<h2>Exploration</h2>
- **Missions**: Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, and Juno. Juno, currently in orbit, is studying the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, and internal structure.<br>
- **Future Missions**: Plans for future exploration include missions that may target its moons, particularly Europa, which is of interest due to its potential subsurface ocean.

<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
- **Mythology**: Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter has been a subject of interest in mythology, literature, and astronomy throughout history.<br>

Jupiter's immense size, complex atmosphere, and fascinating moons make it a critical focus for planetary science and exploration.
